Using convolutional neural networks (CNN) for high dimensional data such as images has shown some promising results, but it has issues with features without spatial correlation. I test a streamlined version of the REFINED (REpresentation of Features as Images with NEighborhood Dependencies) model and compare its performance on a ligand binding site detection dataset. I find no significant evidence supporting that this method has better predictive power than state-of-the-art approaches or CNNs using matrices with randomly assigned feature positions.
