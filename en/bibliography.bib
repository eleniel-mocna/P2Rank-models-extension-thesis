abstract={Ligand binding site prediction from protein structure has many applications related to elucidation of protein function and structure based drug discovery. It often represents only one step of many in complex computational drug design efforts. Although many methods have been published to date, only few of them are suitable for use in automated pipelines or for processing large datasets. These use cases require stability and speed, which disqualifies many of the recently introduced tools that are either template based or available only as web servers.},

    abstract = { Random forests are one of the state-of-the-art supervised machine learning methods and achieve good performance in high-dimensional settings where p, the number of predictors, is much larger than n, the number of observations. Repeated measurements provide, in general, additional information, hence they are worth accounted especially when analyzing high-dimensional data. Tree-based methods have already been adapted to clustered and longitudinal data by using a semi-parametric mixed effects model, in which the non-parametric part is estimated using regression trees or random forests. We propose a general approach of random forests for high-dimensional longitudinal data. It includes a flexible stochastic model which allows the covariance structure to vary over time. Furthermore, we introduce a new method which takes intra-individual covariance into consideration to build random forests. Through simulation experiments, we then study the behavior of different estimation methods, especially in the context of high-dimensional data. Finally, the proposed method has been applied to an HIV vaccine trial including 17 HIV-infected patients with 10 repeated measurements of 20,000 gene transcripts and blood concentration of human immunodeficiency virus RNA. The approach selected 21 gene transcripts for which the association with HIV viral load was fully relevant and consistent with results observed during primary infection. }

To this end, we have previously developed a stand-alone tool, P2Rank, and the web server PrankWeb (https://prankweb.cz/) for fast and accurate LBS prediction. Here, we present significant enhancements to PrankWeb. First, a new, more accurate evolutionary conservation estimation pipeline based on the UniRef50 sequence database and the HMMER3 package is introduced. Second, PrankWeb now allows users to enter UniProt ID to carry out LBS predictions in situations where no experimental structure is available by utilizing the AlphaFold model database. Additionally, a range of minor improvements has been implemented. These include the ability to deploy PrankWeb and P2Rank as Docker containers, support for the mmCIF file format, improved public REST API access, or the ability to batch download the LBS predictions for the whole PDB archive and parts of the AlphaFold database.}",
