\chapter{Code and data availability and usage}

A software framework was developed to run these experiments. This code can be accessed on \href{https://github.com/eleniel-mocna/Refined}{the project GitHub repository}. In this chapter, I'll describe the individual run configurations. Because of the time and memory requirements, there is no single configuration to run all experiments, which would be impractical. Instead, I'll describe the individual run configurations so that individual experiments can be reproduced.

\section{Configuration}

The configuration for this pipeline is governed by the \texttt{config.json} file. Here, the main parameters can be adjusted. The most important
