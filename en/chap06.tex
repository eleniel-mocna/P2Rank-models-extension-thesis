\chapter{Code and data availability and usage}

A software framework was developed to run these experiments. This code can be accessed on \href{https://github.com/eleniel-mocna/Refined}{the project GitHub repository}. In this chapter, I'll describe the individual run configurations. Because of the time and memory requirements, there is no single configuration to run all experiments, which would be impractical. Instead, I'll describe the individual run configurations so that individual experiments can be reproduced.

\section{Detailed metrics}
\label{metrics_availability}

For each model described in this work, I calculated many more metrics. These mainly include per-protein metrics. For all types of models, I uploaded a sample model to the aforementioned repository into \texttt{data/published\_models}. There are more models there, which always have a README attached to them describing the way the model was trained.

\section{Configuration}

The configuration for this pipeline is governed by the \texttt{config.json} file. Here, the main parameters can be adjusted. The most important
