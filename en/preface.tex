[TK: AI] The field of drug discovery and bioinformatics increasingly leverages Machine Learning (ML) models for predicting protein-ligand interaction sites. Understanding these interactions forms a crucial aspect of rational drug design and aids in the development of new therapeutics. While several ML models exist for this purpose, challenges persist. The accurate prediction of ligand binding sites on proteins remains a complex problem due to the vast conformational space sampled by both the protein and potential ligands, along with the need for incorporation of diverse chemical and biological information related to the protein structure. \\

In this thesis I'm expanding P2Rank, a state-of-the-art algorithm for ligand binding sites prediction, by introducing new models in place of the original random forest classifier described in the original paper [TK: CITE].
